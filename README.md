# **GUI Analog Clock Project**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to create a functional **Analog Clock** using Python's Tkinter and Pillow libraries. It focuses on building a real-time updating analog clock with rotating clock hands for hours, minutes, and seconds. The clock is drawn dynamically, where each time update is displayed on the Tkinter canvas. The project also incorporates an image of a clock face that is updated every second.

---

## **Purpose of the Project**

The purpose of this project is to:
- Gain a deeper understanding of **Tkinter** for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- Learn how to manipulate images using the **Pillow** (PIL) library.
- Practice **datetime** manipulation in Python.
- Implement real-time updates for a GUI application.
- Combine knowledge of Python's **math** library to calculate the rotation angles for the clock hands.

## **Key Features**

1. **Dynamic Clock Hands**: 
   - The clock hands (hour, minute, second) rotate in real-time to reflect the actual current time.
   
2. **Custom Clock Face**:
   - The clock face is an image that is dynamically updated every second.
   - The hour, minute, and second hands are drawn over the clock face.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The current time is fetched using Python’s `datetime` module.
   - Angles are calculated for each hand based on the time to update the clock hands.

4. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Using Tkinter's `.after()` method, the clock updates every second.

5. **Image Manipulation**:
   - The clock face image (`cl.jpg`) is resized and placed on a blank canvas created with the Pillow library.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: The main programming language used to develop the project.
- **Tkinter**: Used to build the GUI window and update the clock.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Used to handle image manipulation (clock face) and drawing clock hands.
- **datetime**: Used to retrieve the current system time (hour, minute, second).
- **math**: Used to calculate the positions of the clock hands based on angles.

## **What I Learned**

1. **Tkinter and GUI Programming**: 
   - I learned how to build and manage GUI applications using Tkinter.
   - I practiced placing widgets such as labels, buttons, and handling image updates in real time.

2. **Pillow Image Manipulation**:
   - I explored how to resize and manipulate images with the Pillow library.
   - I learned how to draw shapes like lines and ellipses, which were essential for creating the clock hands.

3. **Real-time Updates in Tkinter**:
   - By using the `.after()` method, I was able to implement real-time updates for the clock’s hands.

4. **Mathematics for Rotation**:
   - I utilized trigonometry (sine and cosine functions) to rotate the clock hands correctly based on the time.
   - I learned how to convert time units (e.g., hours, minutes, seconds) into angles for drawing the clock hands.

5. **Working with Images and GUI Components**:
   - I learned how to combine static images with dynamic graphical elements (like clock hands) to create a visually appealing and functional analog clock.

## **Outcome of the Project**

The outcome of this project is a fully functional analog clock that:
- Displays the current time with accurate and rotating hour, minute, and second hands.
- Refreshes every second to stay up-to-date.
- Uses an image of a clock face and draws the clock hands dynamically on top.
- Is implemented in a GUI window using Tkinter, which is a useful foundation for building more complex applications.

## **Future Improvements**

- **Add Digital Time**: Include a digital clock representation alongside the analog clock.
- **Enhance Aesthetics**: Improve the design, such as adding a more realistic clock face and better graphics for the clock hands.
- **User Settings**: Allow the user to customize the clock face and hand colors, or choose a different clock image.
- **Time Zones**: Add functionality to show the time in different time zones.

---

## **How to Run the Project**

1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Install the necessary libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install pillow
   ```
3. Place the clock image (`cl.jpg`) in the same directory as the Python script.
4. Run the Python script:
   ```
   python analog_clock.py
   ```
